# Middleware


**Middleware** is a type of computer software program that provides services to software applications beyond those available from the operating system. It can be described as "software glue".

**Middleware** makes it easier for software developers to implement communication and input/output, so they can focus on the specific purpose of their application. It gained popularity in the 1980s as a solution to the problem of how to link newer applications to older legacy systems, although the term had been in use since 1968.
